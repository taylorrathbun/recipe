   <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
   <p>All of these ingredients can be found at your local grocery store. However, going to an apple orchard and picking your own apples, gives you quality time with your loved ones, and a fun day.</p>
   <p><b> *Crust</b><p>
     <ul>
       <li>2 ½ cups of all-purpose flour</li>
       <li>1 cup (2 sticks or 8 ounces) of unsalted butter (cold, cut into 1/2 inch cubes)</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon of sugar</li>
       <li>6-8 tablespoon of ice water</li>
     </ul>
   <p><b> *Filling</b></p>
   <ul>
     <li>8 cups of thinly sliced, peeled apples (variety, medium-sized)</li>
     <li>½ cup of sugar</li>
     <li>2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour</li>
     <li>¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
     <li>¼ teaspoon of salt</li>
     <li>⅛ teaspoon of ground nutmeg </li>
     <li>1 tablespoon of lemon juice (optional)</li>
   </ul>

  <h2>Preparation</h2>
  <p>It is best to prepare the crust before the filling. If you do not have time to make the crust, or simply do not want to make it, you can substitute by using the Pillisbury brand.</p>
  <p><b>*Crust</b></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Mix flour, sugar, and salt into a medium sized bowl. Mix until well blended together.</li>
    <li>Add butter, half at a time, mixing well as you add after each. Mix until the large pieces are the size of large peas. </li>
    <li>Slowly add the cold water. Sprinkle the mixture with about 1/4 cup of cold water and mix. Then add more cold water, a tablespoon at a time, mixing after each addition until the dough just barely begins to hold together.(You know that the mixture is ready if when you pinch some of the crumbly dough together with your fingers, it sticks together. Be careful with the amount of water you add, too much and the crust will be tough.)</li>
    <li>Make two dough disks. Empty the crumbly dough mixture from the food processor on to a clean, dry, surface. Gather the mixture in a mound.</li>
    <li>Divide the dough mixture into two even-sized mounds. Using your hands, knead each mound to form a disk shape. Do not over-knead! (Kneading develops gluten which will toughen the dough, and is not something you want in a pastry crust.) You should only knead enough so that the dough holds together without cracks.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle each disk with a little flour and wrap each one in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for one hour or up to 2 days.</li>
    <li>Remove dough from refriferator and let sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes in order to soften just enough to make rolling out a bit easier.</li>
    <li>Roll out dough with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface to a 12-inch circle; about 1/8 of an inch thick. As you roll out the dough, check if the dough is sticking to the surface below. If necessary, add a few sprinkles of flour under the dough to keep the dough from sticking.</li>
    <li>Carefully place the dough onto a 9-inch pie plate. Gently press the dough down so that it lines the bottom and sides of the pie plate.</li>
    <li>Add filling to the pie. </li>

  <p><b>*Filling</b></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat oven to 425℉.</li>
    <li>In large bowl, add the peeled and sliced apples.</li>
    <li>Gently mix the filling ingredients into the bowl filled with apples.</li>
    <li>Spoon the ingredients from the bowl into the crust-lined pie plate.</li>
    <li>Top with the second crust, wrapping excess top crust under the bottom crust edge, pressing edges together to seal.</li>
    <li>Cut slits or shapes in several places in top crust.</li>
    <li>Add some butter on top of the pie crust</li>
    <li>Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until apples are tender and crust is golden brown.</li>
    <li> Let cool on cooling rack at least 2 hours before serving.</li>
</ol>

Can you figure it out? </p>
