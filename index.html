   <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

       <li>2 ½ cups of all-purpose flour</li>

       <li>6-8 tablespoon of ice water</li>

   <h4>Preparation:</h4>
      <p>It is best to prepare the crust before the filling. If you do not have time to make the crust, or simply do not want to make it, you can substitute by using the Pillisbury brand.</p>

   <h5>Crust</h5>
   <ol>
     <li>Mix flour, sugar, and salt into a medium sized bowl. Mix until well blended together.</li>
     <li>Add butter, half at a time, mixing well as you add after each. Mix until the large pieces are the size of large peas. </li>
     <li>Slowly add the cold water. Sprinkle the mixture with about 1/4 cup of cold water and mix. Then add more cold water, a tablespoon at a time, mixing after each addition until the dough just barely begins to hold together.(You know that the mixture is ready if when you pinch some of the crumbly dough together with your fingers, it sticks together. Be careful with the amount of water you add, too much and the crust will be tough.)</li>
     <li>Make two dough disks. Empty the crumbly dough mixture from the food processor on to a clean, dry, surface. Gather the mixture in a mound.</li>
     <li>Divide the dough mixture into two even-sized mounds. Using your hands, knead each mound to form a disk shape. Do not over-knead! (Kneading develops gluten which will toughen the dough, and is not something you want in a pastry crust.) You should only knead enough so that the dough holds together without cracks.</li>
     <li>Sprinkle each disk with a little flour and wrap each one in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for one hour or up to 2 days.</li>
     <li>Remove dough from refriferator and let sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes in order to soften just enough to make rolling out a bit easier.</li>
     <li>Roll out dough with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface to a 12-inch circle; about 1/8 of an inch thick. As you roll out the dough, check if the dough is sticking to the surface below. If necessary, add a few sprinkles of flour under the dough to keep the dough from sticking.</li>
     <li>Carefully place the dough onto a 9-inch pie plate. Gently press the dough down so that it lines the bottom and sides of the pie plate.</li>
     <li>Add filling to the pie.</li>
   </ol>

   <h5>Filling</h5>
   <ol>
     <li>Heat oven to 425℉.</li>
     <li>In large bowl, add the peeled and sliced apples.</li>
     <li>Gently mix the filling ingredients into the bowl filled with apples.</li>
     <li>Spoon the ingredients from the bowl into the crust-lined pie plate.</li>
     <li>Top with the second crust, wrapping excess top crust under the bottom crust edge, pressing edges together to seal.</li>
     <li>Cut slits or shapes in several places in top crust.</li>
     <li>Add some butter on top of the pie crust</li>
     <li>Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until apples are tender and crust is golden brown.</li>
     <li> Let cool on cooling rack at least 2 hours before serving.</li>

  <p>My name is Taylor Rathbun and I am a senior at Emmanuel College in Boston, MA. Along with baking, I enjoy playing sports, taking pictures and hiking in my free time. I am also an avid animal lover and love spending time with my chocolate lab Bailey and puppy nephew, a Newfoundland Hound, Memphis.</p>
  <p>I have been making this apple pie recipe since I was 12 years old. I started making this recipe with my dad for holidays and fmaily events, and now it has become a tradition. Everytime I make this apple pie, I am always told how good it is and what recipe I use. This recipe may seem like any ordinary apple pie recipe, however there is a slight change. Can you figure it out? </p>

 <p> I hope you enjoy this recipe, and share this delicious apple pie with your loved ones.</p>
